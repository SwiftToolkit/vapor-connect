# VaporConnect

This is the final sample project of the post [Embedding Vapor in a CLI Tool](https://SwiftToolkit.dev/embed-vapor-cli-tool), at SwiftToolkit.dev.

It allows interacting with an executable tool from the browser, sending messages and getting responses.

# Usage

First, clone this project. Then, in the root directory, use SPM to build and run the executable:

```sh
swift run
```

For more details on how to interact with the executable, check the full post.
